/* JS Template Literals
Synonyms: Template Literals, Template Strings, String Templates, Back-ticks String.
Template = format for a document
Literal = original, precise, exact, in JS it is a notation for representing a fixed value
in our code. What does that mean?
Also, literal as opposed to non-literal?

Well, in programming in general a literal is a fixed value.
Like saying: */ 
var five = 5; // and using "five" in some math, just use the number 5 literally.

// So in an OOP language an object literal would be something like:


/*The entire thing is my object. Things between my {} are my literals. 
My notation is a pattern "name:value".
The string interpolation in JavaScript is performed by template literals 
(strings wrapped in backticks ``) and ${expression} as a placeholder.
Template Literals use back-ticks (``) rather than the quotes ("") to define a string:

// Quotes Inside Strings - With template literals, you can use both single and double
// quotes inside a string or we can use multiple string:

Homework:
1. Create variables for 3 types of animals with their age for each animal
2. Log in console string saying : "Dog Alfie is 3 year old and he loves 3 year old cat Mimi
and 4 year old mouse Barney! Wow!", the old way with concatenation.
3. Rewrite same string in a new way with template literals by using backticks and ${} expressions.
