/* JS Template Literals
Synonyms: Template Literals, Template Strings, String Templates, Back-ticks String.
Template = format for a document
Literal = original, precise, exact, in JS it is a notation for representing a fixed value
in our code. What does that mean?
Also, literal as opposed to non-literal?

JavaScript Literals are constant values that can be assigned to the variables that are 
called literals or constants. JavaScript Literals are syntactic
representations for different types of data like numeric, string, Boolean, array, etc data.
Like saying: */ 
const five = '5'; // string literal is enclosed in quotes
let six = "six";

// An object literal is a list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated
// values of an object, enclosed in curly braces ({}):
let new_dog = {
  name: "Wolfy",
  good_dog: false
}

/*The entire thing is my object. Things between my {} are my literals. 
My notation is a pattern "name:value".
The string interpolation in JavaScript is performed by template literals 
(strings wrapped in backticks ``) and ${expression} as a placeholder.
Template Literals use back-ticks (``) rather than the quotes ("") to define a string:
*/
let day = `Monday`;

// Quotes Inside Strings - With template literals, you can use both single and double
// quotes inside a string or we can use multiple string:
let night = `We can see "Orion Belt"`;
console.log(day, night);


// String Interpolation (insert something of a different nature into something else)ðŸ˜¹ .
// easy way to interpolate variables and expressions into strings.
// replacement of variables with real values The syntax is: ${...}
let something = "water";
let somehtingElse = "bucket";
let syntax = "syntax ${...}";
let backTicks = "``"

let say = `We use backticks (${backTicks}) to insert ${something} into ${somehtingElse}
with (${syntax})`;
console.log(say);


// HTML Templates
//Template literals provide an easy way to interpolate variables and 
//expressions into strings.The method is called string interpolation.

Homework:
1. Create variables for 3 types of animals with their age for each animal
2. Log in console string saying : "Dog Alfie is 3 year old and he loves 3 year old cat Mimi
and 4 year old mouse Barney! Wow!", the old way with concatenation.
3. Rewrite same string in a new way with template literals by using backticks and ${} expressions.
